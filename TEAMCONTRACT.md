TEAM CONTRACT

Communication

Team Meetings - Our team will meet once a week, on Saturdays. We will meet starting from 3pm and meet in person for 1 hour minimum. The designated location will be on the 4th floor of the Grainger Library. We will keep track of our progress as we go. 

Assistance - We have a group chat with all of our phone numbers where we can reach each other quickly. We expect a somewhat quicker response from our members, but if any member is busy they can always respond to messages later. Best case within 1 hour, worst case within a few hours. 

Respect - We will respect each otherâ€™s opinions during meetings and make sure that everyone is able to speak when they want to, whether it be through the group chat or during our in person meetings. 


Collaboration

Work Distribution - Based on the workload of each member that week, appropriate tasks will be distributed to account for prior time commitments. If one person has a busy week, they can take on a task that requires less of a time commitment that week. Ultimately, communication will be the best way for all the work to be completed, and every team member to have an equal distribution of the work.

Time Commitment - On average, each member of the group should spend the same amount of time on this project weekly as they do on MPs. We will meet weekly as a team to talk about any prior commitments team members may have, and get organized for the week. This is also the time we can get a lot of questions answered for each other. We will keep each other accountable for our work and distribution to the group. If anyone is consistently not doing work, we will reach out to them as a group and think of a solution.

Conflict Resolution - If we have situations where there is a disagreement towards members, we will discuss them during our Saturday meetings and remain courteous and respectful of each other's opinions. In the hypothetical situations that a member is habitually late, we will give them reminders to come to the meetings an hour before the meeting and if needed, even closer to the meeting.
