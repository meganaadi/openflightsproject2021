 We are working on fixing the Project proposal for our mentor to approve. Since the landmark algorithm isn’t a viable option, we are replacing it with the Iterative deepening depth-first search algorithm for our complex option. We are implementing a DFS for our traversal and adding it’s runtime, input and output. In addition, we are adding our runtimes for our other algorithms, as we had forgotten to do so earlier. We will be using Dijkstra's Algorithm for our shortest path algorithm. The weights in our graph will be representing distance between the airports in the graph.

We have completed the initial skeleton for the project, where we have created classes for airports and routes to represent the verticies and edges. We also wrote helper and utility classes to read the data files regarding the airports and routes. We also developed several test cases for making sure the code compiles and the file is loaded properly.

Added graph class implemenation 
implemented user handling commands 
added minor changes for airports and routes

11/28/2021
Doing our weekly meeting/progress report for the week.
Possibly making minor changes in the Airport class and Route class, maybe adding an operator, and adding a function to check if the airports are the same (but not a definite change). We are also changing up our traversal to BFS. We will be getting started on our BFS implementation and it will be completed by the end of the week, and also starting on the Dijkstra's algorithm. 

12/06/2021
We finished working on the template for our individual parts at this point. During the meeting we went over our individual parts. This includes BFS, Dijkstra's algorithm, and the IDDFS algorithm. We clarified a few implementations as well as worked together to resolve any issues that came up. The algorithms are now working, so we are working on test cases.
