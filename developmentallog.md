 We are working on fixing the Project proposal for our mentor to approve. Since the landmark algorithm isn’t a viable option, we are replacing it with the Iterative deepening depth-first search algorithm for our complex option. We are implementing a DFS for our traversal and adding it’s runtime, input and output. In addition, we are adding our runtimes for our other algorithms, as we had forgotten to do so earlier. We will be using Dijkstra's Algorithm for our shortest path algorithm. The weights in our graph will be representing distance between the airports in the graph.
