# sjamma2-madiga2-mhu26-zeyut2
Final Project for sjamma2-madiga2-mhu26-zeyut2

human-readable README which describes: (1) The location of all major code, data, and results. (2) Full instructions on how to build and run your executable, including how to define the input data and output location for each method. (3) Full instructions how to build and run your test suite, including a general description on what tests you have created. It is in your best interest to make the instructions (and the running of your executables and tests) as simple and straightforward as possible.



Our Project is stored in a large folder called mp_flight. The OpenFlights dataset is stored in the data folder within mp_flight. The data is separated into 3 different datasets. One with a smaller dataset named airports_small.dat, another with all of the data in the CSV, called airports.dat, and the last one containing the routes of the airplanes, which are the edges in our project. The search algorithms are stored in a folder within mp_flight called search. Dijkstra's algorithm and implementation are in the search_dijkstra.h and search_dijkstra.cpp files. The BFS Traversal implementation is contained within search_BFS.h and search_BFS.cpp. And finally the Iterative Deepening Depth First Search is implemented in search_IDDFS.h and search_IDDFS.cpp. RESULTS:..................
